# Motion Sickness Helper 2
A PAYDAY 2 mod merge that removes motion sickness inducing camera effects. Name inspired by the [PAYDAY: The Heist mod of the same name](https://modworkshop.net/mod/40746).

## Mods Included
- [No ADS Breathing Effect](https://modworkshop.net/mod/21246)
- [No ADS Recoil Animations](https://modworkshop.net/mod/25619)
- [No Screen Shake](https://modworkshop.net/mod/22471)
- [Bag Carrying Tilt Removal](https://modworkshop.net/mod/16487)

## Mod Merge Goals
- Provide a robust, bug-free merge that will work with any setup.
- Easy customizability by simply removing the lines of code you dont want to use.
- No feature overcreep, ala what happened to my "updated" version of Sniff Utils 2.
- Seperated sections of mods to provide a more "pick and choose experience".
